Follow FCL README Instructions (install libccd, optionally octomap, then install fcl)

Copy CMakeLists.txt

BVH = bounded volume hierarchy - tree structure that divides objects into bounding groups (boxes) to help separate them

AABB = axis-aligned bounding box (minimum bounding box such that the edges are parallel to the cartesian axes)

OBB = oriented bounding box

RSS - rectangle sphere swept bounding volume

SAP - sweep and prune


TODO:
    1. I have no idea how FCL decides to draw the shapes (like in what direction and such)



FCL surrounds a cylinder with a hexagonal prism to find collisions

check distance between environment object and robot links
cartesian product of collision objects and robot objects
collide with self
