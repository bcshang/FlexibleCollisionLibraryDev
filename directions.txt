Follow FCL README Instructions (install libccd, optionally octomap, then install fcl)

Vocabulary:
BVH = bounded volume hierarchy - tree structure that divides objects into bounding groups (boxes) to help separate them
AABB = axis-aligned bounding box (minimum bounding box such that the edges are parallel to the cartesian axes)
OBB = oriented bounding box
RSS - rectangle sphere swept bounding volume
SAP - sweep and prune

General Notes about FCL functionality:
FCL surrounds a cylinder with a hexagonal prism to find collisions
I think fcl will automatically delete collision objects when the collision manager is cleared. If an out of memory exception occurs, it might be the CollisionLink not properly deallocating the collision object

TODO List:
allow for updating of joints
check distance between robot links
collide with self - for this, ignore any that have a similar joint number
figure out how to make an item without using new
fix the freaking collision link types
write an update
I don't know why there are multiple collisions for the torso box
I don't know why the torso sometimes doesn't register properly
the joint orienatation thing won't work for the left arm because of how I build the objects


Updates:
    1. I don't know how to do a nice cartesian product but I can return the distance
