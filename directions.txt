Follow FCL README Instructions (install libccd, optionally octomap, then install fcl)

Vocabulary:
BVH = bounded volume hierarchy - tree structure that divides objects into bounding groups (boxes) to help separate them
AABB = axis-aligned bounding box (minimum bounding box such that the edges are parallel to the cartesian axes)
OBB = oriented bounding box
RSS - rectangle sphere swept bounding volume
SAP - sweep and prune

General Notes about FCL functionality:
FCL surrounds a cylinder with a hexagonal prism to find collisions
I think fcl will automatically delete collision objects when the collision manager is cleared. If an out of memory exception occurs, it might be the CollisionLink not properly deallocating the collision object
I update the robot_model within the updating of the collision model. This shouldn't be a problem but may be redundant
I ignore any self collision with the torso


TODO List:
check distance between robot links
figure out how to make an item without using new
fix the freaking collision link types
I don't know why there are multiple collisions for the torso box
I don't know why the torso sometimes doesn't register properly

What doesn't translate correctly:
Some configurations are really inaccurate, just try pressing the randomize button

Updates:
    1. I don't know how to do a nice cartesian product but I can return the distance
    2. The rotation works better as a post multiply
