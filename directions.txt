Follow FCL README Instructions (install libccd, optionally octomap, then install fcl)

Vocabulary:
BVH = bounded volume hierarchy - tree structure that divides objects into bounding groups (boxes) to help separate them
AABB = axis-aligned bounding box (minimum bounding box such that the edges are parallel to the cartesian axes)
OBB = oriented bounding box
RSS - rectangle sphere swept bounding volume
SAP - sweep and prune



TODO List:
check distance between robot links
figure out how to make an item without using new
fix the freaking collision link types
I don't know why there are multiple collisions for the torso box
I don't know why the torso sometimes doesn't register properly

Updates:
    1. I don't know how to do a nice cartesian product but I can return the distance
    2. The rotation works better as a post multiply
    3. The arms and legs rotate properly now, kinda
    4. Self collision works
    5. dynamically updates from the valkyrie model
    6. Some configurations (with the legs) are really inaccurate but I can't really fix that
