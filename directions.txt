Follow FCL README Instructions (install libccd, optionally octomap, then install fcl)

Copy CMakeLists.txt

BVH = bounded volume hierarchy - tree structure that divides objects into bounding groups (boxes) to help separate them

AABB = axis-aligned bounding box (minimum bounding box such that the edges are parallel to the cartesian axes)

OBB = oriented bounding box

RSS - rectangle sphere swept bounding volume

SAP - sweep and prune

Questions:
    - Is there a nice way to find the meshes already parsed for valkyrie?
    - Else what library should I use to parse it?


TODO:
    1. difference between different types of bounding boxes and their uses
